# New Reddit Redirect


Dislike OLD Reddit's Design, and people keep sending you old.reddit.com links ? NEW Reddit Redirect will ensure that you always load the new (new.reddit.com) design instead.

Will force all reddit.com usage to new.reddit.com. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, using old bookmarks. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in incognito mode.

#### Redirected domains

- `old.reddit.com`


#### Whitelisted domains

- `reddit.com`
- `www.reddit.com`
- `np.reddit.com`
- `amp.reddit.com`
- `i.reddit.com`
